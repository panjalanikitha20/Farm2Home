#  Farm2Home – A Digital Marketplace for Farmers and Consumers

**Farm2Home** is a command-line simulation project developed in **C** that bridges the gap between local farmers and consumers. It allows farmers to list their fresh produce with pricing and quantity, and enables customers to browse, place orders, and receive digital billing. This project aims to promote local sourcing, reduce supply chain inefficiencies, and provide a hands-on learning experience in C programming.
